# AI for Green Transportation Routes

## Overview
This project uses AI and graph algorithms to suggest eco-friendly transportation routes that minimize CO₂ emissions. It combines vehicle data, traffic, and elevation information to recommend the "greenest" route between locations.

## Objectives
- Estimate CO₂ emissions for different routes.
- Optimize paths for low pollution rather than just short distance.
- Build a simple web app prototype using Streamlit.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NetworkX
- Streamlit
