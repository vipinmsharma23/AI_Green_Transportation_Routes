# 🌱 AI for Green Transportation Routes

**Internship:** Shell-Edunet Skills4Future (AICTE x Shell)  
**Duration:** Oct 2025 – Nov 2025  
**Theme:** Sustainability  
**Intern:** Vipin Sharma  
**GitHub Repo:** [AI_Green_Transportation_Routes](https://github.com/vipinmsharma23/AI_Green_Transportation_Routes)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to suggest **eco-friendly transportation routes** that minimize CO₂ emissions based on:
- Vehicle type  
- Traffic conditions  
- Road elevation and distance  

Goal → To create a simple prototype that demonstrates how data-driven route optimization can reduce overall emissions and support green mobility.

## 🧩 Week 1 Progress
**Scope defined + Environment setup completed**
- Created folder structure:  
- Installed dependencies (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, networkx, matplotlib, jupyter).  
- Initialized Git repository and pushed base project.  
- Prepared sample data and notebook for upcoming route-emission analysis.

## 🧠 Expected Outcome
A working **prototype app** that:
- Loads route data (synthetic or open-source)
- Estimates emissions for different paths
- Recommends the *greenest route* for a given origin and destination
