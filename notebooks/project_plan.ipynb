    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Current navigation systems prioritize shortest or fastest routes, not environmental sustainability.\n",
    "This project aims to build an AI model that recommends eco-friendly routes minimizing CO₂ emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "- Create a dataset of routes with vehicle, traffic, and emission data.\n",
    "- Train a regression model to estimate CO₂ emissions.\n",
    "- Use graph algorithms to find least-polluting paths.\n",
    "- Build a prototype Streamlit app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 1 Tasks\n",
    "- Define project scope ✅\n",
    "- Set up environment and folder structure ✅\n",
    "- Create GitHub repo ✅\n",
    "- Start preparing dummy dataset (next week)\n"
